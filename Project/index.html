		<p>
			One of Lowell Observatory's primary tools for observing the night sky is their 4.3 meter spectrograph. This
			spectrograph is controlled manually, with a researcher using the fortran based commands on every clear night
			in order to get all of the measurments they need. In addition to learning fortran, a spectrograph operator
			also needs three to four hours to set up the spectrograph. In order to solve this, Empyrean is creating a
			front-end interface to allow astronomers to automatically configure their spectrograph, gather observations,
			and provide those observations for viewing later.
		<p>

		</figure>
		<p>
			Creating this will allow the astronomers at Lowell to be able to make all of their observations anywhere
			they have an Internet connection, instead of needing to go into the observatory any time they want to gather
			data. This will in turn increase the amount of research astronomers can collect by reducing time to learn
			the spectrograph, as well as decrease the time needed to complete set up each night. This system will also
			be modular, allowing for other observatories to create accounts for their spectrograph, speeding up their
			process as well.
		</p>
		<h1 class="content-header">High Level Requirements</h1>
		<p>
			For Lowell to receive the product they were envisioning, the following requirements must be filled: sending
			commands to spectrograph including location data and image request type, tracking users for later use,
			storing large amounts of data from the spectrograph, creating an API capable of calling fortran commands,
			showing previouly collected data in an organized format, and being an open source project for other
			astonomer's use. See our Requirements Specification document below for more information.
		<p>

		<h1 class="content-header">Envisioned Solution</h1>
		<p>
			At the most general level our project will need a website, an API backend, and a database. The website
			should include a login and the ability to send commands to the backend and request data from the database.
			This will fulfill the requirements of tracking users and having an interface to send commands to the
			spectrograph. The backend needs to be able to handle requests from the website and send those commands to
			the spectrograph, locate and retrieve data from the database, and handle the incoming data from the
			spectrograph. This fulfills the requirements of an API for use with fortran commands, gathering the data
			from the database, and handling the interface commands. Finally the database should hold large amounts of
			data and will thus need to be highly scalable for long term use. All code created should be completely open
			source, allowing other astronomers to use the interface. Finally the project needs to be as modular as
			possible, which will allow astronomers as Lowell and anywhere else easily link code to the project.
			A succinct description of our envisioned solution can be found in our informational poster below.

		<h1 class="content-header">Technologies Used</h1>
		<p>
			Most of the technologies we will use to accomplish our envisioned solution have already been chosen by our
			client. The frontend will be created using ReactJS, HTML, and CSS while the backend will be built with
			Flask.
			We will also need a database to store all of the spectrograph data and at this current moment we have not
			yet chose a database.
